### *About the Game*
Ignite your nostalgia with this Bop-it! virtual game, modeled after the beloved 90's Hasbro toy. This Vanilla JS game offers two game play modes: a conventional *timed* mode similar to Hasbro's standard gameplay, and a memory-based game where all that matters is sequence.
***
### *Technologies Used*
This game was built using HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla Javascript within VS Code editor. Additional applications leveraged include GarageBand and Apple Music.

### *Getting Started*

The main landing page is where you will select your game play mode. Once the mode is selected, you will be presented with the option to start, or display a demo of the buttons on the game console. 

1. **Traditional Bop-it!**
   * The computer will call out (via text at the top page and sound) the command. Hover around the various levers. Bop-it! is the center, circular button, flick-it is the green button in top left, twist-it is the yellow button top-right, spin-it is red in the bottom-left, and pull-it is the blue bottom-right.
   * You will only have a certain amount of time to execute the click command the computer calls out. Click it fast and be ready for the next command!

2. **Memory Bop-it!**
     * Memory mode works in a similar capacity to the game Simon. The computer will call out an array of commands, to which you then have to replicate in order. This array of commands will grow in length and it's up to you to remember the order! There is no time limit.

### *Bonus Feature*
#### Check out the dance party feature in the upper left hand corner for a surprise!
***
 ### *Future Updates*
#### Coming Soon:
1. **Dance Party** In the future, dance party will only be available to individuals who achieve a certain high score within the two modes.
2. **Memory Mode** As an update, memory mode will be more difficult as it will not allow a player to select options in the sequence until the commands have completed.
3. **Two-player 'Pass-it' mode** The game will allow for multiple players using the traditional 'pass-it' mode from Bop-it Extreme.
4. **Traditional mode** will include more obstacles in addition to speed, including a rotating console and other distractions.

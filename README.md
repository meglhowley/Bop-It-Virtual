### *Description*
#### Ignite your nostalgia with this Bop-it! virtual game, modeled after the beloved 90's Hasbro toy. There are two game-play modes:
1. Traditional Bop-it! The computer will call out a random command (i.e. bop-it, pull-it, twist-it, flick-it, spin-it) and you have a limited amount of time to execute the button click. High score is calculated based on how many "clicks" you make it through.
2. Memory Bop-it! The computer will push random commands to an array, and you have unlimited time to execute the commands, but they must be in correct order. Array grows over time. HS based on how many clicks you make it through. 
### *Getting Started*
#### The main landing page is where you will select your game play mode. Details below for how to play each:
1. Traditional Bop-it!
   * The computer will call out (via text at the top page and sound) the command. Hover around the various levers. Bop-it! is the center, circular button, flick-it is the green button in top left, twist-it is the yellow button top-right, spin-it is red in the bottom-left, and pull-it is the blue bottom-right.
   * You will only have a certain amount of time to execute the click command the computer calls out. Click it fast and be ready for the next command!
2. Memory Bop-it!
     * Memory mode works in a similar way to the traditional game simon. The computer will call out an array of commands, to which you then have to replicate in order. This array of commands will grow in length and it's up to you to remember the order! There is no time limit.
